## What Gets Installed

Once the installation is complete, you should have the following items installed in the local folder **"%public%\Documents\Infragistics\Reveal\SDK\"**:

- The Reveal SDK Binaries (for manual use)
- The Reveal SDK NuGet Packages

There is also a local NuGet package source automatically added to Visual Studio that points to the Reveal SDK NuGet packages.

## Adding Your License Key

By default, when you install the Reveal SDK for the first time using the Reveal SDK Installer only the **trial** product is installed. In order to unlock the **licensed** product, you must provide a license key in the installer.

Providing a license key to the installer can be done in two ways:
1. Find the extracted Reveal SDK Installer EXE file and double click to start it.
2. In Windows, go to **Setting -> Apps** and modify the Reveal SDK installation

Once you have either modified the existing install, or re-run the Reveal SDK Installer, you will be prompted with a screen to either "Repair", "Remove", or "Enter License".  Choose **Enter License**

After you choose **Enter License**, you will be taken to a screen in which you can now enter your license key.
