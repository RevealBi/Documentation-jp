## Supported Languages

The general User Experience (UX) can be customized applying application themes, changing localization and regional settings, or even including further customization with the Reveal SDK.

Reveal will detect and apply the language and regional settings configured in the different platforms, including:

  - **Web browser**

  - **Windows**

  - **Mobile devices (Android and iOS)**

> [!NOTE]
>**About Date Format in Visualizations**
>The date format used in Reveal visualizations can be customized by field **in the Visualization editor**. Doing so will effectively override the "general" format.

The available languages are English, German, Spanish, French, Italian,
Japanese, Korean, Malay, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese
(Traditional and Simplified).

In addition, you can explicitly configure within Reveal the language
used for email notifications and the Notification center. To do this, go
