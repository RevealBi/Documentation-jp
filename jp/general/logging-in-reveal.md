Before jumping in, take into account that in Reveal you can join an **Organization**. If you are a member of an organization, you have to log in with your organizationâ€™s email. Choose Google (G Suite) or Microsoft (O365) as needed and you'll be associated with the organization team. Alternatively, you can log in using your iCloud (*Apple*) account credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> The organization team is named after your organization (e.g. your company's name).

Depending on which account you used to sign in Reveal, you will have your OneDrive or Google Drive automatically added to your list of [data sources](~/en/datasources/overview.md). You will be additionally asked for **limited permissions** only the first time you use your [OneDrive](~/en/datasources/OneDrive.md) and [Google Drive](~/en/datasources/Google-Drive.md).

### Your First Screen

Once you get in, you are greeted with your first screen:

You always start in your personal space, **My Stuff**.

### What About Roles & Permissions?

In Reveal, people can join an organization and one or more teams. Roles and permissions apply to both organizations and teams.  
Roles represent a set of permissions assigned to a Reveal user in relation to a team or an organization. This means every user is assigned a role when joining organizations or teams. There are three different roles (owner, member, viewer) with a clear set of permissions each.
