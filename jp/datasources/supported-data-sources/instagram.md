The Instagram data source allows you to connect your Instagram Business account data to Slingshot. With the help of insightful dashboards, you can have a better overview of the brand awareness of your company.

## Connecting an Instagram Business account to Slingshot

1.	Select **Instagram** as your data source. You can find it under **Social Media** in the data sources list.
2.	Log in to your Instagram Business account. If you don’t have one, you can head [here](https://business.instagram.com/getting-started) to find more information about how you can create a new account. Keep in mind that you need to connect a Facebook page to the Instagram Business account first. You can click [here](https://help.instagram.com/399237934150902) to find more information about how you can do that.
3.	A dialog will open, where you can change the name of the data source, add a description, see if the data source is certified and edit the details.

You will be presented with two sections in their own query field:

- **Dimensions (depicted by a cube icon with a pink side)**: Here you can find the attributes of your data that you want to measure.
- **Measures (depicted by 123 icon)**: Measures consist of numeric data. For example, you can see how many account followers your website (under the Account cube with a pink side) has.

## The date range data filter

You can filter your data by selecting a specific date range. Keep in mind that the data filter can’t be removed but you can change the default date range (*Last 7 days*).

To change the date range, you can click on the filter and then click on the arrow in the upper right corner.
