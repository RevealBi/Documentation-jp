## Working in the Visualizations editor

When you create a dashboard with information coming from a LinkedIn Ads account, you will see that there are two sections in their own fields.

1.	**Dimensions**: They are the attributes of your data.
2.	**Measures** (depicted by 123 icon): They consist of numeric data. For example, you can see the number of clicks by regions.

## The Data Range Data Filter

This filter can’t be removed but you can change the date range. The date filter is set to *Last 30 days* by default.

If you want to change it, you can click on the arrow in the upper right corner (see the screenshot below) and pick a date range from the dropdown menu or create a custom one when you click on the first option.
