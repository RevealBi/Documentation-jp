## Data Sources


Data Sources are the places where your data comes from. Reveal provides
you with the opportunity to connect to different enterprise data sources. You can choose from analytics tools, content managers, cloud services, CRMs,
databases, spreadsheets, and public data sources.

The screenshot below displays a number of different data sources the user John Williams has connected to in his application.

### Connecting to Data Sources

To retrieve information from a data source and use it for your visualizations you need to connect to it first. Once you have connected to a data source, it will be saved in the _Select a Data Source_ menu (see the screenshot above) for quick selection next time you need it.

To connect to a data source, perform the steps below.  

1. From the *Home screen*, click/tap the **+ Dashboard** split blue button.
