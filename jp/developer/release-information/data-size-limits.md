#Data Limits

There are size limits server-side when using Reveal Web regarding the size of files downloaded, the number of cells in a result set (after aggregation), size of pivot tables and grids (given as a number of cells).
The objective of these limits are to prevent our servers to run out of resources (memory and disk space.

Default limit Values:

-	200mb when downloading csv/json/excel
-	10 million cells
-	64 million characters (adding all the strings in all cells).
